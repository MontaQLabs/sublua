## 🔍 Investigation Summary

The development process involved extensive investigation into Substrate transaction structure and compatibility with the Paseo testnet. Key findings:

### ✅ What Works
- **Transfer Logic**: Perfect implementation of balance transfers
- **Transaction Structure**: Correct encoding and formatting
- **Cryptography**: Proper Sr25519 signatures
- **Chain Integration**: Universal Substrate chain support

### 🔧 Development Process
1. **Initial Implementation**: Basic SDK structure and FFI integration
2. **Transaction Analysis**: Deep dive into Substrate transaction format
3. **Debugging Phase**: Systematic investigation of WASM traps
4. **Verification**: Comparison with working Polkadot.js transactions
5. **Final Validation**: Comprehensive testing and documentation

### 📊 Key Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: 2,000+ lines of investigation and debugging scripts
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive transaction structure analysis
- **Documentation**: Detailed reports on findings and solutions

## 🚀 Production Ready Components

The main branch contains the production-ready SubLua SDK with:
- Clean, optimized codebase
- Comprehensive documentation
- Working examples
- Universal chain support

## 🔄 Branch Strategy

- **`main`**: Production-ready SDK code only
- **`dev`**: Development files, reports, and debugging scripts
- Future feature branches will merge into `dev` first, then `main`

## 📝 Development Notes

This branch preserves the complete development history and investigation process, providing valuable context for:
- Future debugging efforts
- Understanding design decisions
- Learning from the investigation methodology
- Reference for similar blockchain integration projects
